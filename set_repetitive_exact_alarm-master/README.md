# set_repetitive_exact_alarm
This project is about how to use the Alarm Manager API to set Exact alarms irrespective of doze or standby modes provided by the framework. You can execute your tasks at the given particular time.
In the demo at the exact time, the notification will be built through the Alarm Receiver. I have also shown how to use the set Exact method as a repetitive alarm because the default setRepetitive alarm doesn't trigger in the given time so this logic will help you out to perform repetitive tasks in a nice way.
